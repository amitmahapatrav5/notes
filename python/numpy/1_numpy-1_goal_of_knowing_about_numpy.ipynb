    "- I feel numpy, is used heavily in various places, specially in Deep Learning. Because in deep learning, we need arrays of various dimensions of array, for testing the model architecture, feeding data to model and various other tasks. numpy is your best friend there.\n",
    "- In my experience, it is majorly used internally in pandas, pytorch, and I believe tensorflow as well.\n",
    "- I discovered, numpy syntax is extreamly similar to torch's numpy like module.\n",
    "- So, goal of learning numpy, for me, is learn about dimensions and that will help you in knowing one other library, called torch and it will provide very much environmental familarity while working on deep learning model. "
