# Pandas is based on numpy
# Main 3 things in pandas are Series, Dataframe and Index
# Series is 1 Dimensional
# Dataframe is 2 Dimensional and basically collection of Series
# Index is used in both Series and Dataframe objects
# Key difference between NumPy and Pandas Array is
    # NumPy array elements are indexed implicitly by position
    # In Pandas we can assign our own explicit labels
