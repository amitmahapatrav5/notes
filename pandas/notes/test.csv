I woke up about at 4am in the morning and it's because I had a kind of bad vision of a tiger and crocodile in my sleep. I got scared and then my mind gets into the thought of my manager arguing with me last Friday. I kept thinking about that and resigning my current company. Finally I took my phone and saw a podcast of James Clear and before that I am filling out this form.,2023/12/17,Filled,5,NA,NA,"December 17, 2023 5:49 AM"
I woke up in the first alarm itself at 8. But I didn't get up because of the fan in my bedroom was making the air cold. So I felt lazy and kept myself in the bed. Why I get up now is because my conscious felt that if I don't get up now it would be really late. To be honest I am late enough to give good amount of time to practice competative programming. I need to be strong and get up early. But I am proud of myself,2023/12/18,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 18, 2023 9:41 AM"

I used a bigger and more comfortable blanket last night and the sleep was really really good and nice. So I didn't want to get out of it and hence the late. I also didn't have the activities that I am going to do today which could be another reason.,2023/12/21,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 21, 2023 10:38 AM"
Today again I am late. I need to plan properly what I am going to do on the day and based on that I should think and that should wake me up.,2023/12/22,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 22, 2023 10:17 AM"

"The delay in waking up time is happening due to 2 reasons mainly. Reason 1 being I am watching tv show which is making me sleep late. Reason 2 when I wake up, I m not getting out of bed, instead I m staying in bed enev though I m not completely in sleeping state. One additional reason I think is the fan is making the temperature low which is preventing me to get out of blanket.",2023/12/28,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 28, 2023 9:49 AM"
I literally woke up today at 6:30 and also awake at 7. But in my mind I thought I had nothing to do. So I kept procrastinating and eventually I woke up now about at 10. Today is the last working day of the year. Let's see how this goes.,2023/12/29,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 29, 2023 10:23 AM"

"Well the reason I slept late last night because I started watching a new tv show last night in Hotstar. The show has 1 season, 10 episodes each of length about 25 mins on an average. I wanted to kind of finish it. But I saw if I do so, it will be too late sleep. And eventually I slept around after 3:30 am. I should not start watching any new show and Target to complete by the night itself. Otherwise next day I will wake up late, next day night I will sleep late and eventually the late wake up will get in my routine.",2023/12/31,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"December 31, 2023 11:02 AM"

"I woke up with the 7am alarm. But I literally did not feel like waking up. I woke up at 8, 9:30 and 9:50 but I waited till 10 and then finally woke up. The reason why this happened is because I have cold today and that why I am giving myself excuse that I can wake up a bit late. So finally I can say, I am capable of waking up at 10 everyday. But I have to make myself wake up by 7. I want that 3 hours of reduction. I hope this happens gradually. I will try to wake up at 9 everyday from tomorrow.",2024/01/03,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"January 3, 2024 10:03 AM"
"Today's timing of sleeping and waking up was really horrible. I kept watching the Turkish TV show last night and didn't stop, which kept me going and eventually I didn't sleep till 7am in the morning. This must not happen. This majorly happened today because I didn't stop watching the TV Show. I need to find out a solution for such. This will destroy the habit which I am trying to make. Wake up time is really important as every habit is directly dependent on that.",2024/01/04,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"January 4, 2024 11:06 AM"

"I woke up around at 7:40 am today, because of Maa's call. But I am recording this after talking to my mom then my sister and then my mom again. The call was regarding some issues my sister had which she did not feel like an issue. It is identified by mg causin and called my mom. She got panicked and called me and asked to go visit my sister. However I denied, because I kind of knew that this is probably nothing. I called my sister to verify and she said it's nothing. I then called back my mom. The moral of the thing is, I didn't handle the situation correctly. It could be handled in a better way.",2024/01/07,Filled,-5,NA,NA,"January 7, 2024 8:27 AM"

I slept late last night. I was using talklife after a long time. It felt nice. My sleep was also good. But the only issue is I woke up really late. I think I should take such breaks in times.
