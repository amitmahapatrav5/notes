# Back Propagation

Formula: $ W = W - \eta \* \frac{\delta{CF}}{\delta{W}} $

We are trying to minimize the cost function with respect to Weights

So in 2D, Dimension 1 is Weight and Dimension 2 is Cost Function Value and we are trying to find out, for which Weight, W, Cost Function value is minimum.

$ \frac{\delta{CF}}{\delta{W}} $

$ \frac{\delta{ \sigma { ( X^{T}W, \hat{Y} ) } } }{\delta{W}} $

```python
