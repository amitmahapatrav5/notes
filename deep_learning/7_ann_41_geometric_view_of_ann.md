Pre-Requisite:

Feature Space is a geometric representation of the data, where each feature is an axis and each observation is a coordinate. In practice, we have very high dimension of feature space.

Model output can be of 2 types, categorical or continuous
Categorical:
Input Features: Sleep Duration, Study Duration
Output: Pass/Fail

Continuous:
Input Features: Sleep Duration, Study Duration
Output: Marks Secured
