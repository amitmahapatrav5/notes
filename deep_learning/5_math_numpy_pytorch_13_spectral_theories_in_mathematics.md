# Spectral theories in mathematics

## Difference between Complecated and Complex Systems

| Feature           | Complicated                     | Complex                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parts             | Lots of parts                   | Few or many parts                                              |
| Nonlinearities    | Linear or few nonlinearities    | Many nonlinearities                                            |
| Understandability | Intuitive and/or understandable | Counter- or unintuitive, difficult or impossible to understand |
| Examples          | Car, phone, SVD                 | Chaos, biology, Conway's game of life                          |

Deep Learning is

**Simple**, because it's made of simple, easy math (mostly).

**Complicated** because it contains many parts.

**Complex** because of myriad nonlinearities and because it is unintuitive and difficult to understand.
