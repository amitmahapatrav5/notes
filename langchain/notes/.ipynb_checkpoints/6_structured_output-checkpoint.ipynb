    "- Why this is needed? LLM generally respond in a natural language. But, if you want to make your llm request some data from a given API, then llm has to provide the response in a specific format(which is usually given by the user). This concept is very much required while building agents.\n",
    "- To get structured output, we need to have some idea on Pydantic python third party package and TypedDict from core python.\n",
    "- In market whatever LLMs are present, some can generate structured output and some cannot.\n",
    "- But using langchain, we can generate structured output from both these types.\n",
    "- For the LLMs which can provide structured output, there is a method called `.with_structured_output()`\n",

    "- Its pretty simple. After creating Model instance, we invoke the `.with_structured_output()` method on it and it returns an instance of the model which can return structured output.\n",
    "- Only thing we need to know is, the method, needs the format in which the output will be returned. That format can be given in 3 ways.\n",
    "  1. Using built-in Typed Dictionary\n",
    "  2. Using Pydantic\n",
    "  3. JSON Schema\n",
    "- `.with_structured_output()` method takes a parameter called `method`. That parameter value can be `Literal['function_calling', 'json_mode', 'json_schema']`.\n",
    "  - If you want the structured output generated by the LLM to be used for function calling, you can use the value `function_calling`.\n",
    "  - If you want the structured output generated by LLM in JSON format(could be for API call or some other reason), use the value `json_mode`."
